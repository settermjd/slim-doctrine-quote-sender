# Developer Daily Quote Sender

This is a small project which a series of tutorials for the Twilio blog will be based.
The intention of the project is to show how to build a project using Slim Framework, Doctrine, and two Twilio services;

- SendGrid

## About

The application allows users to subscribe to receive daily developer quotes, such as "_Don't comment bad code - rewrite it._", by Brian Kernighan, by both SMS and email.
It's another take on the daily quote services that are pretty common place around the internet.

The application has a Docker Compose configuration to simplify getting it up and running as quickly as possible, and to help document the application's requirements.
